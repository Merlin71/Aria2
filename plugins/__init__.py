## @brief Empty init file - allow to __import__ function to load data from folder
## @par
# The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages;
#  this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string,
#  from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path.
#  In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code
#  for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
